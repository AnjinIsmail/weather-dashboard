# Weather-dashboard

## Description

The main objective is to create a Weather app that retrieves weather data for cities. 

Below is the list of main objects to be met in staisfying the traveler using the weather app.The overall goal is for the traveler to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they may plan their trip accordingly.

### 1- provide a weather dashboard with form inputs.
### 2- upon searching for a city, they are presented with current and future condition for that city, also the city is added to their search history.
### 3_ upon viewing the current weather conditions for that city the following appears on screen- 
    - City name
    - Date
    - Icon representation of weather conidtions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
    - The wind speed
    - UV index
### 4- when viewing the UX index , depending on the conditions of the weather, colors should display favorable, moderate or severe.
### 5- under viewing future weather conditions for that city, 5 day forecast displays: the date , an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
### 6- when clicking on a city in the serach history, current and future coniditions for that city are displayed again.

### Current issues I am running into :
1- Upon clicking on the histroy list, the pervious data/content doesnt clearout. As a result, multiple citie data are displayed (crowded)
2- Local storage data is not presistant: 
    - When entering a city name in  the search form, the city name is stored in local storage
    - Once the page is refreshed and a new city is entered, the new city name will replace the pervious local storage's data.
